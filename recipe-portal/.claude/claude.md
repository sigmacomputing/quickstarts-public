The recipe portal has been fully implemented with all core functionality working correctly. Version 1.0 includes robust authentication, smart parameters, race condition fixes, and comprehensive recipe execution capabilities.

## âœ… VERSION 1.0 FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

### Authentication System
- **Multi-Configuration Support**: Named configs for different environments (Production, Staging, etc.)
- **Configuration-Specific Token Caching**: Isolated token storage per client configuration
- **Race Condition Fixes**: AbortController-based request cancellation prevents mixed authentication data
- **Seamless Config Switching**: No browser refresh required when switching between authentication configs

- **Cross-Configuration Isolation**: Parameters refresh correctly when switching authentication configs
- **Real-time Updates**: Parameters update immediately upon authentication changes

### Recipe Execution Engine
- **Binary File Support**: Proper handling of PDF, CSV, and other binary downloads
- **Multi-Output Methods**: Browser downloads AND console responses
- **Extended Timeouts**: 5-minute timeout for long-running operations (materialization, exports)
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time status updates during execution
