# QuickStarts API Toolkit - VERSION 1.0 COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Project Status: PRODUCTION READY
The recipe portal has been fully implemented with all core functionality working correctly. Version 1.0 includes robust authentication, smart parameters, race condition fixes, and comprehensive recipe execution capabilities.

## ‚úÖ VERSION 1.0 FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

### Authentication System
- **Multi-Configuration Support**: Named configs for different environments (Production, Staging, etc.)
- **Configuration-Specific Token Caching**: Isolated token storage per client configuration
- **Race Condition Fixes**: AbortController-based request cancellation prevents mixed authentication data

## üîß AUTHENTICATION CONFIG RACE CONDITION FIX

### Problem Description
When switching between different authentication configurations (e.g., Production vs Staging environments), endpoint operations would use data from the wrong Sigma instance. This occurred because:

1. User authenticates with Config A (e.g., AWS US West)
2. User switches to Config B (e.g., GCP) and authenticates  
3. Smart parameters and API calls still used the baseURL from Config A
4. Operations returned data from the wrong Sigma environment

### Root Cause Analysis
The race condition was caused by:
- Token cache files only stored `token` and `clientId` but not the associated `baseURL`
- API routes used hardcoded/environment baseURLs instead of auth config baseURLs
- Frontend components didn't pass the current config's baseURL through to API calls
- No connection between cached authentication tokens and their originating server configurations

### Solution Implementation (August 2025)

**1. Enhanced Token Storage**
- Modified `recipes/get-access-token.js` to cache `baseURL` and `authURL` with tokens
- Updated `app/api/token/route.ts` to return baseURL with token data
- Enhanced token cache structure to include server configuration

**2. API Route Updates**  
- `/api/resources/route.ts`: Now accepts `baseURL` parameter and uses it for all fetches
- `/api/call/route.ts`: Uses provided baseURL instead of environment default
- `/api/execute/route.ts`: Caches tokens with their associated baseURL/authURL

**3. Frontend Component Chain**
- `app/page.tsx`: Stores and passes `authBaseURL` from auth config
- `components/CodeViewer.tsx`: Retrieves and passes baseURL to SmartParameterForm
- `components/SmartParameterForm.tsx`: Uses baseURL for resource API calls
- `components/QuickApiExplorer.tsx` & `QuickApiModal.tsx`: Pass baseURL for API operations

**4. Race Condition Prevention**
- All API calls now use the baseURL from the current authentication configuration
- Token cache includes server configuration to prevent cross-environment data mixing
- AbortController cancellation prevents stale requests from completing

### Files Modified
- `recipes/get-access-token.js` - Enhanced token caching
- `app/api/token/route.ts` - Return baseURL with tokens  
- `app/api/resources/route.ts` - Accept and use provided baseURL
- `app/api/call/route.ts` - Use auth config baseURL
- `app/api/execute/route.ts` - Cache tokens with server config
- `components/CodeViewer.tsx` - Store and pass authBaseURL
- `components/SmartParameterForm.tsx` - Use baseURL for resource calls
- `components/QuickApiExplorer.tsx` - Pass baseURL to modal
- `components/QuickApiModal.tsx` - Use baseURL for API calls
- `app/page.tsx` - Track authBaseURL state

### Testing Strategy
1. Authenticate with Config A (e.g., AWS US West)
2. Load smart parameters - verify data is from Config A environment
3. Switch to Config B (e.g., GCP) and authenticate
4. Load smart parameters - verify data is now from Config B environment
5. Execute recipes - confirm operations use correct Sigma instance
6. Verify no cross-environment data contamination

### Prevention Measures
- All authentication tokens now include their originating server configuration
- API calls require explicit baseURL parameter instead of using defaults
- Frontend components maintain auth config state throughout the chain
- Request cancellation prevents race conditions during config switching

This fix ensures that endpoint operations always use data from the correct Sigma instance matching the current authentication configuration.

## üö® CRITICAL BUG FIX: Authentication Configuration Selection Race Condition (August 28, 2025)

### Issue Discovered
Even after implementing the comprehensive race condition fix above, a **deeper issue** was discovered where the authentication script (`get-access-token.js`) was **always using the default configuration** from encrypted storage instead of the user-selected configuration.

### Symptoms
- User clicks "End Session" and clears all tokens ‚úÖ
- User selects "PhilB - PROD" configuration from dropdown ‚úÖ  
- User clicks "üîê Authenticate Now" ‚úÖ
- **BUG**: System still authenticates with "QS Fundamentals" (default config) ‚ùå
- Token created with wrong clientId (`8f92dcde` instead of `77d4c471`) ‚ùå
- API calls return data from wrong Sigma environment ‚ùå

### Root Cause Analysis
The authentication script had **no mechanism** to receive the user's configuration selection:

```javascript
// In get-access-token.js - BEFORE FIX
function getStoredCredentials(configName) {
  // configName was always undefined!
  let targetName = configName;
  if (!targetName) {
    // Always fell back to default
    targetName = allCredentials._metadata?.defaultSet || Object.keys(allCredentials).find(k => k !== '_metadata');
  }
}
```

**The authentication modal UI had config selection, but the selection was never passed to the authentication script.**

### Detailed Fix Implementation

**1. Authentication Script Enhancement**
```javascript
// Modified recipes/get-access-token.js
async function getBearerToken(configName) {
  // NEW: Allow configName via environment variable for portal integration
  const envConfigName = process.env.CONFIG_NAME;
  if (!configName && envConfigName) {
    configName = envConfigName;
    console.log('Using config name from environment:', configName);
  }
  // ... rest of function
}
```

**2. Frontend Integration**
```javascript
// Modified components/CodeViewer.tsx
// For authentication script, always add CONFIG_NAME to debug
if (fileName === 'get-access-token.js') {
  console.log('DEBUG AUTH SCRIPT - selectedCredentialSet:', selectedCredentialSet);
  allEnvVariables['CONFIG_NAME'] = selectedCredentialSet || '';
  console.log('Added CONFIG_NAME to env variables:', allEnvVariables['CONFIG_NAME']);
}
```

**3. Environment Variable Chain**
- UI stores `selectedCredentialSet` when user selects configuration
- `CodeViewer.executeScript()` passes it as `CONFIG_NAME` environment variable
- `/api/execute` route includes `CONFIG_NAME` in environment variables
- `get-access-token.js` reads `process.env.CONFIG_NAME` and uses selected config

### Verification Logs
**Working Fix Evidence:**
```
DEBUG AUTH SCRIPT - selectedCredentialSet: PhilB - PROD
Added CONFIG_NAME to env variables: PhilB - PROD
Using config name from environment: PhilB - PROD
Successfully decrypted config for: PhilB - PROD
ClientId starts with: 77d4c471  // ‚úÖ CORRECT CONFIG
```

**Before Fix (Broken):**
```
Requested config name: undefined
No config name provided, using: QS Fundamentals
ClientId starts with: 8f92dcde  // ‚ùå WRONG CONFIG (default)
```

### User Workflow (Fixed)
1. Click "End Session" to clear all tokens
2. Click "Authentication Required" to open modal
3. **Select desired configuration** from "Quick Start - Load Saved Config" dropdown
4. Click "üîê Authenticate Now"
5. System now correctly authenticates with the **selected** configuration
6. All subsequent API calls use the correct Sigma environment

### Development Environment Note
**CRITICAL**: This bug was only visible in **development mode** (`npm run dev`). Using `npm start` (production mode) showed cached/pre-built code that didn't reflect changes. Always use development server when debugging authentication issues.

### Files Modified for This Fix
- `recipes/get-access-token.js` - Accept CONFIG_NAME environment variable
- `components/CodeViewer.tsx` - Pass selectedCredentialSet as CONFIG_NAME

### Prevention Strategy
- Authentication script now explicitly logs which configuration is being used
- Environment variable mechanism ensures user selection reaches the authentication script
- Development/production mode distinction is clearly documented for future debugging

This fix completes the authentication configuration switching system, ensuring users can seamlessly switch between different Sigma environments without any race conditions or default configuration fallbacks.
