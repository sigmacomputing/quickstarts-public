*   Name: query_history_enriched.sql
*   Dev:  Oscar Bashaw (with credit to Select.dev for their cost-per-query calculation)
*   Date: Dec 13 2024
*   Summary: create query_history_enriched table and set up incremental materialization
*   Desc: This series of commands will do the following:
*           1. Set session variables
*           2. Create the query_history_enriched table that includes all queries started on or before yesterday
*           3. Grant the role used in your Sigma connection access to the query_history_enriched table
*           4. Create a stored procedure that enriches queries not yet in the query_history_enriched table (and 
*              that were run on or before the most recently completed day) and insert them into query_history_enriched
*           5. Create and start a task to call that stored procedure using the specified CRON string (Once per day Mon-Fri at 3am PT)
*                   
*   Prereqs: To run this script the following is required:
*           - Ability to use the SYSADMIN role (just briefly, to give the proper privileges to another role)
*           - The name of the role used in your Sigma connection
*           - Verify that there is data in the views in the SNOWFLAKE.ORGANIZATION_USAGE schema
